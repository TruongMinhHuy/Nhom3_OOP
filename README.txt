Be informed that this feature is under research and may cost heavily to develop!
Current options: 
-Runs on Rasperry Pi 4: our Unity chess game does not support PI OS, which means we can't directly runs a server on the Rasperry Pi.
-Runs on External Machine (PC or cloud services): will cost >5$ a month to maintain and might get a bit complicated than needed.
-Runs on LAN: this will work perfectly for the project, but to deploy it means we have to do "Port Fowarding", if you care to search you will find out that most ISPs in Vietnam blocked this feature due to secrutiy risks and etc, we can try contacting them.
